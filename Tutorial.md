# How to make a RC car
## A tutorial on how to create a remote controlled car using arduinos.

This guide outlines how to setup the controller and motorised components of an RC vehicle, this guide can be used as part of an outline for how to create a DIY remote control car. Now if you haven’t checked out the tutorial on how to create wireless communications we’d recommend you check it out → here - Its not compulsory to complete this tutorial but it will give you a better idea of how the RC car functions.

### Components:
2 arduinos (one for transmitting and one for receiving)

2 nRF24L01+ Wireless Modules (you can use other modules but you will have to figure out how to wire them yourself)

Male to Female Jump wires (you’ll need 10)

Male to Male Jumper wires

2 joysticks

1 bread board

2 motors(with wheels)

Chassis base

H-bridge (using a shield is easier but we will cover both in this tutorial)

1 swivel caster


There are many other ways to create an RC car, this is merely one of many potential designs 

### Step 1- Chassis building:
It would be fair to say that if the chassis doesn’t work your likely hood of creating a successful remote controlled car is slim.

### Step 2- Circuitry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Controller**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Car**


Connect the car circuitry to the chassis

### Step 3- Code
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Controller code**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**RC Car code**

### conclusion



Problems are very common, especially if this is your first project working with wireless communications

Now that we are done consider additions that you could make to this design to make it epic.
